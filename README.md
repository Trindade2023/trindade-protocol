## 📌 Overview
The **Trindade Protocol** is a proprietary multi-layered software architecture designed to mitigate hallucination and existential risks in AI systems. Unlike standard LLM wrappers, Trindade employs a **Recursive Adversarial Architecture** to enforce logic and safety constraints before any action is executed.

## 🛡️ Core Features
*   **Layer 1 Pure Logic Core:** Stateless, IO-Free deterministic processing.
*   **ALARP Risk Management:** 5x5 Matrix implementation with automatic Veto protocols.
*   **Semantic Safety Triggers:** Automatic containment (CI-5) for existential threats.
*   **Domain Agnostic Routing:** Automatically switches between Creative, Structured, and Adversarial engines.
