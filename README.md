## 📌 Overview
The **Trindade Protocol** is a proprietary multi-layered software architecture designed to orchestrate Artificial Intelligence agents in high-stakes environments. 

Version **1.9.7** introduces the **"Omni-Sovereign"** paradigm: a kernel capable of operating under strict bureaucratic standards during peacetime (preventing liability) yet seamlessly transitioning to military-grade survival axioms during crises (preventing catastrophe).

## 🛡️ Core Innovations (v1.9.7)

### 1. Dual-State Logic Core (Layer 1 & 5)
The system automatically detects the operational context:
*   **Standard Profile:** Enforces strict legal compliance (e.g., Anti-Bias < 10%) to prevent lawsuits and regulatory fines.
*   **Defense Profile:** Elevates mission success and physical safety above administrative constraints during declared emergencies.

### 2. Anti-Skynet Protocols (Layer 3)
*   **Semantic Sharding:** High-stakes tasks (CI-5) are fragmented into blind sub-tasks. No single sub-agent possesses the full context of a dangerous operation.
*   **Inter-Shard Collusion Detection:** The Kernel monitors for steganographic communication between agents. Any correlation triggers an immediate **System Wipe**.

### 3. Forensic & Legal Integrity (Layer 0 & 5)
*   **Real-Time Notarization:** Generates blockchain-ready anchors for decision auditing.
*   **Forensic Watermarking:** All inputs are cryptographically stamped to track provenance and prevent data poisoning.

## 📜 License Strategy (Dual Licensing)
This repository uses a hybrid protection model to ensure integrity and commercial viability:

1.  **Software (BUSL-1.1):** Free for research/non-commercial use. Commercial production requires a license.
2.  **Documentation (CC BY-NC-ND):** Free to share, protected against modification or resale.
