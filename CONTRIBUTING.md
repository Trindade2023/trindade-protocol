# Contribution Policy

Thank you for your interest in the **Trindade Protocol**.

Due to the **Proprietary and Safety-Critical nature** of this architecture, and to maintain strict Intellectual Property integrity under the BUSL-1.1 License, we have a specific policy regarding external contributions.

## 1. Code Contributions (Pull Requests)
**We DO NOT accept external code contributions (Pull Requests) to the Logic Kernel (`trindade_kernel.py`).**

The Core Logic must remain a strictly controlled environment, architected solely by the Primary Seed to guarantee:
1.  **Security Integrity:** Preventing supply-chain attacks or backdoors.
2.  **IP Unity:** Ensuring 100% of the copyright remains with the Licensor for commercial licensing stability.
3.  **Architectural Consistency:** Adherence to the Principle of Non-Reduction.

*Any Pull Request submitted to the Core will be closed without review.*

## 2. Bug Reports & Issues
We highly value community feedback regarding stability and security. You are encouraged to open an **Issue** if you find:
*   Logical inconsistencies in the execution flow.
*   Security vulnerabilities (Please treat critical vulnerabilities confidentially).
*   Typos or errors in the Specification PDF.

## 3. Commercial Partners
If you represent an enterprise and wish to develop custom Adapters or integrate the Trindade Protocol into your infrastructure, please contact the Architect directly for a Commercial License and Partnership Agreement.
